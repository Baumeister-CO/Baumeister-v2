                We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a
                particularly high priority for the management of the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages
                of the Agentur Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data
                subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could
                become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for
                such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
            </p>
            <p class=" leading-relaxed">
                The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a
                data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
                accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur Baumeister.
                By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of
                the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
                subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are
                entitled.
            </p>
            <p class=" leading-relaxed">
                As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures
                to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
                Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be
                guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative
                means, e.g. by telephone.

                <p class=" leading-relaxed">
                    The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data and information when a data
                    subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in
                    the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating
                    system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our
                    website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet
                    site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the
                    accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of
                    attacks on our information technology systems.

                <p class=" leading-relaxed">
                    When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister does not draw any conclusions
                    about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
                    correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the
                    long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide
                    law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a
                    cyber-attack. Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister analyzes anonymously collected data and information
                    statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise,
                    and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of
                    the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

            <h2>8. Legal basis for the processing</h2>
            <p>
                Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent
                for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance
                of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing
                operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is
                based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary
                for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products
                or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is
                required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c
                GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
                data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were
                injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to
                be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1)
                lit. d GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for
                processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is
                necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
                except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
                data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
                permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that
                a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47
                Sentence 2 GDPR).

            <p>
                Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to
                carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.

            <h2>10. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
            <p>
                The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory
                retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long
                as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.

                into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of
                failure to provide such data</h2>
            <p>
                We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can
                also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may
                be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must
                subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal
                data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would
                have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The
                employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or
                contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide
                the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
